# Shopping Cart

This is a SwiftUI implementation of a simple shopping cart heavily
inspired by
[calmm-js/karet-shopping-cart](https://github.com/calmm-js/karet-shopping-cart).

The interesting point of this example is that you can implement simple
custom `Binding`s that behave similarly to lenses. See
[Binding+Extensions.swift](Shopping%20Cart/Binding/Binding%2BExtensions.swift)
for examples.
